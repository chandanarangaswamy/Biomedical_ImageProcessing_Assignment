    "1)image : array\n",

    "Explanation :\n",

Each tile's contrast is enhanced so that the histogram of each output region approximately matches the specified histogram (uniform distribution by default). The contrast enhancement can be limited in order to avoid amplifying the noise which might be present in the image.\n"

    " 1)Let us Simulate a Motion Blur first\n",
    " Simulate a blurred image that you might get from camera motion. Create a point-spread function, PSF, corresponding to the     linear motion across 31 pixels (LEN=31), at an angle of 11 degrees (THETA=11). To simulate the blur, convolve the filter with the image using imfilter.\n",

    " 2)Then we Restore the Image from thhe Blurred Image\n",
    "   The simplest syntax for deconvwnr is deconvwnr(A, PSF, NSR), where A is the blurred image, PSF is the point-spread function,    and NSR is the noise-power-to-signal-power ratio. The blurred image formed in Step 2 has no noise, so we'll use 0 for NSR.\n",
